=head1 NAME

solexa2fastq - converts Bustard seq and prb files into fastq format

=head1 SYNPOSIS

solexa2fastq [options] s_1_1_seq.txt ...
solexa2fastq [options] bustard_dir ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This converts a Bustard output files (I<*_seq.txt> and I<*_prb.txt>,
and optionally GERALD*/*_qcal.txt) into Fastq format. Only the
I<seq.txt> files need to be specified on the command line as the
program will automatically read either the associated I<prb.txt> or
I<qcal.txt> file. Alternatively specifying a directory acts as a
synonym for reading all I<*_seq.txt> files from within that
directory. Any number of files or directories may be specified, with
all translations being concatenated and written to stdout.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item --trim <integer>

This specifies how many bases to trim from the start of the
sequence. This now defaults this is "0", but older runs will likely
require "1". (Should this be specifying use-bases and an
nYYYYY.. string instead to allow trimming off the other end too?)

=item --name_sub <perlop>

This is a perl expression applied to the generate the reading name.
It may use the perl variables $machine, $run, $lane, $tile, $x, $y and
$count with the the first two being computed from the current working
directory and the latter being an auto-incremented counter. By default
it uses "IL\${machine}_\${run}_\${lane}_\${tile}_\${x}_\${y}".

For example to use the older solexa2fastq default of
s_<lane>_<tile>_<counter> you'd specified:

--name_sub '"s_${lane}_${tile}_${count}"'

A more complex example could be:

--name_sub 'sprintf("s_%d_%04d_%X_%X", $run, $tile, $x, $y)'

=item --calibrated

This boolean flag indicates that the quality values should be fetched
from the *_qcal.txt files in the GERALD directory.

=item --gerald_dir <directory name>

This specifies the GERALD output directory to use with the --calibrated flag.
Without it the last (sorted by name, not time) one found in the
directory is used instead. Note that there is an implicit assumption that
the Bustard directory is 3 levels lower down than our current working
directory. (This is assumed by when writing the output files to "../../..")
